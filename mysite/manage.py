# Command Line Interface: manage.py provides a command-line interface for managing your Django project. You can use it to perform a variety of tasks, such as:

#     Running the development server: python manage.py runserver
#     Making migrations: python manage.py makemigrations
#     Applying migrations: python manage.py migrate
#     Creating a superuser: python manage.py createsuperuser

# Environment Setup: It sets up the necessary environment variables, such as DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, which tells Django which settings file to use.

# Project Independence: By using manage.py, you can run Django commands without needing to specify your projectâ€™s settings manually each time, making it easier to work with multiple Django projects.
