# The wsgi.py file is a crucial component in a Django project, particularly when deploying the project to a production environment.
#  WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface, which is a specification that defines how web servers communicate with web applications in Python.
#  The wsgi.py file serves as the entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your Django application.

# This docstring provides a brief overview of the file's purpose. It mentions that
# this file contains the WSGI configuration for the 'mysite' project and exposes
# the WSGI application callable as a module-level variable named 'application'.
# The URL provided directs you to the Django documentation for more details.

import os
# The 'os' module is imported to interact with the operating system. This is used to
# set environment variables.

from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
# The 'get_wsgi_application' function is imported from 'django.core.wsgi'. This function
# creates a WSGI application that can be used by any WSGI server to forward requests to your
# Django application.

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'mysite.settings')
# This line sets the 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' environment variable to 'mysite.settings'.
# This tells Django which settings file to use. The 'setdefault' method is used here to
# set the environment variable only if it hasn't been set already. This is essential for
# Django to find the correct configuration for your project.

application = get_wsgi_application()
# The 'get_wsgi_application' function is called, and the resulting WSGI application is
# assigned to the 'application' variable. This variable is a callable that the WSGI server
# uses to forward requests to your Django application. The WSGI server invokes this callable
# for every request it receives, and it is responsible for handling the request and returning
# a response.
